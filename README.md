# ocvqc-data

Data required to generate the plots of "On-Chip Verified Quantum Computation with an Ion-Trap Quantum Processing Unit". Directory names correspond to the relevant experiments. Each directory contains a notebook describing how to manage the data. Those notebooks may require [ocvqc-py](https://github.com/CQCL/ocvqc-py).
